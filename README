Apache2::AuthCookieDBI is a module that subclasses Apache2::AuthCookie and is
designed to be directly used for authentication in a mod_perl server.

It is a ticket-issuing system that looks up username/passwords in a DBI
database using generic SQL and issues MD5-checksummed tickets valid for
a configurable time period.  Incoming requests with tickets are
checksummed and expire-time checked.

Version 2.03 and later: mod_perl 1.999_22 and later. Apache::*
