Assuming you have installed the base Docker software on your machine
you can run the tests for this distribution without installing
Apache or mod_perl on your local machine.

Docker allows you to run an entirely different OS as a process
on your local machine.

See: https://docs.docker.com

The docker/ directory in this distribution contains:

  httpd-2.2/
    Dockerfile

  httpd-2.4/
    Dockerfile

You can run the following commands from the top level of this
distribution (it is important that these commands be run from the
top level of this distro):

   docker build -f docker/httpd-2.2/Dockerfile .

or

   docker build -f docker/httpd-2.4/Dockerfile .

Docker will copy the contents of this distro into the virtual
container and run the tests.  The first time you run one of those
commands it will take a while for Docker to create the image
(especially for the 2.2 version where it actually builds perl and
mod_perl so it can take many minutes.) Assuming you don't delete
the Docker images then subsequent runs will be much faster.
